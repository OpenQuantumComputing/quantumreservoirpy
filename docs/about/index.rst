QuantumReservoirPy is a library for Quantum Reservoir Computing. It is based on the classical |ref_reservoirpy| library.

Using quantum computers as reservoirs in reservoir computing is fairly new. The current examples in literature rely heavily on quantum circuits of a very periodic nature. This package is meant to simplify the creation and simulation of such periodic circuits.

QuantumReservoirPy is currently developed and maintained by Alexander Stasik, Franz Georg Fuchs, and Stanley Miao, with previous development by Ola Tangen Kulseng. Any inquiries may be directed to |ref_email|.
